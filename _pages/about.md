Welcome to my website! Working as an Associate Professor of Accounting and Control at RSM, Erasmus University, I employ archival and experimental methods to study the influence of incentive system design, governance mechanisms, target setting practices and performance evaluation on managerial behavior.

I hold a PhD from WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management (Germany) and a MSc degree in Business Information Systems from the University of Münster (Germany). My research has been published in prestigious journals such as <i>The Accounting Review</i>, <i>Journal of Accounting Research</i>, <i>Accounting, Organizations and Society</i>, <i>Management Accounting Research</i> and <i>Abacus</i>. In 2016, my co-authors and I won the David Solomon's prize for the best article of the year in Management Accounting Research. In addition to my research activities, I serve on the editorial board of <i>Behavioral Research in Accounting</i> and as an ad-hoc editor at <i>Management Accounting Research</i>. I am also a reviewer for numerous top journals in the field.

My award-winning teaching experience spans various undergraduate, graduate, and executive programs. I taught courses including Financial Analytics, Financial Decision Making, Management Accounting, Risk Management, Accounting Information Systems, and Fraud and Forensic Investigations. At RSM, I've held several key positions, including the Academic Director of the Accounting and Financial Management program, and memberships on the AACSB/NVAO accreditation team and the master of science program committee. 

I'm actively involved in several initiatives that bridge academic research and professional practice in the field of accounting. I co-organize the annual Erasmus Accounting Workshop, which features innovative research and fosters the network of scholars around the world. Additionally, I served on the Advisory Board for the IMA Corporate Recognition Award, which recognizes corporate innovation in the field of financial management. I've also contributed to doctoral education by participating as a faculty member in doctoral colloquiums, supporting the next generation of scholars. My research initiatives have also been recognized with grant support from CIMA and IMA.
